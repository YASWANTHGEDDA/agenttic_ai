Advanced AWS Services,"This chapter focuses on advanced AWS services that are essential for you to know as a cloud learner. Upon completion of this chapter, you will have complete understanding of Elastic Block Storage (EBS) and its functioning. Similarly, you learn about the Elastic File System (EFS), a cloud-based file storage service, and its functioning. You also review the features and use cases of AWS networking, such as DNS and Route 53. Finally, you look at AWS Direct Connect and its applications in networking, such as AWS Snowball, a petabyte-scale data transport service that uses secure devices to transfer large amounts of data, and the AWS Storage Gateway, a hybrid cloud storage service.",2023,3,OpenAlex

Cloud-Powered Blood Bank Management-Leveraging AWS Services for Efficiency and Scalability,"Blood is an essential element in the healthcare industry, Blood Banks play a vital role in healthcare industry by ensuring the supply of blood and its related products like red cells, platelets, plasma, cryoprecipitate AHF, and granulocytes for necessary medical treatment, in the context of advancement, efficient blood bank management is essential for a reliable supply of needs, this research introduces a novel approach for developing and deploying a hybrid model of cloud-based Blood Bank Management System for serving both networks of hospitals and users within a single application. The Proposed Architecture Utilizes Amazon Web Services like Elastic Cloud Computing or EC2, Amazon Relational Database services and SQL for operations. This research focuses on the hybrid cloud deployment model, offering distinct benefits such as public access to vital information on blood donation and availability, alongside secure blood inventory management for private hospitals. EC2 and RDS enable rapid customization of the user interface to accommodate the diverse needs of these user groups. Architecture is designed to deploy the EC2 to the instance and make it highly available across the regions so that all Real-time processing of data is possible along with high Reliability, Scalability and Fault tolerance for the Application in Blood Bank Management and Healthcare Industry. Through the proposed solution Users can Request and Get Supplied with Blood Based Products and Blood Banks can collaboratively work for the constant supply of related products",2023,2,OpenAlex
OPTICAL CHARACTER RECOGNITION FOR ELECTRONIC INVOICES USING AWS SERVICES,"Optical Character Recognition is basically the mechanical or electronic conversion of printed or handwritten text into machine understandable text. The complication of Optical Character Recognition in different conditions remains as relevant as it was in the past few years. At the present time of automation and innovations, Keyboarding remains the most common way of inputting or feeding data into computers. This is probably the most time consuming and labor-intensive operation in the industry. Automating the process of recognition of documents, credit cards, electronic invoices, and license plates of cars â€“ all of this could help in saving time for analyzing and processing data. With the increased research and development of machine learning, the quality of text recognition is continuously growing better. Our paper is focused on providing a brief explanation of the different stages involved in the process of optical character recognition and through the proposed application; we aim to automate the process of extraction of important texts from electronic invoices. The main goal of the project is to develop a real time OCR web application with a micro service architecture, which would help in extracting necessary information from an invoice.",2021,2,OpenAlex
